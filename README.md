# Results-Summary-Component
 
The challenge is building out this results summary component and getting it as close to the design as possible.


Users should be able to:

    - View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
    - See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
    - Bonus: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content
